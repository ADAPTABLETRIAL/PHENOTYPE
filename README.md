# PHENOTYPE
Eligibility phenotype for potential participant identification.

###Basis
This program is based upon the eligibility criteria from the ADAPTABLE study protocol, [released on October 22, 2015.] (www.pcornet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ADAPTABLE-Final-Protocol-Vers-1-Oct-22-2015.pdf)

To learn more about the development of the study protocol, including the public review and comment process, [more information is available at the study website.] (http://theaspirinstudy.org/2016/01/posting-of-the-draft-protocol-for-public-review-and-comment/)

###Code customization is expected
Please note that this "base phenotype" is **expected to be customized** by the individual institution.

As stated in the protocol, "...patients who meet criteria for secondary prevention after a cardiovascular event will be identified using search algorithms developed by the DCRI Coordinating Center (based on the trial inclusion criteria) and customized by the CDRN for their own EHR systems" (section III.A.3.b.).

###Scope
Not all inclusion/exclusion criteria are including in this SAS code, and some eligibility criteria are confirmed with the participant at enrollment. Please reference [the specification] (https://github.com/ADAPTABLETRIAL/PHENOTYPE/blob/master/ADAPTABLE-base-phenotype-codes.docx?raw=true) for further details.
